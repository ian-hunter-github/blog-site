Learn how to build modern web applications with **React** and **Material-UI**.

## Key Features:
- Pre-built components
- Responsive design
- Easy theming

### Example Button:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';

export default function App() {
  return <Button variant="contained">Click Me</Button>;
}

### **Explanation of the Structure**
1. **Front Matter**:
   The metadata section at the top, enclosed in `---`, contains:
   - `title`: The title of the blog post.
   - `summary`: A brief description of the post.
   - `image`: The path to the image (use `/placeholder.svg` if no image is available).
   - `date`: The publication date.

2. **Markdown Content**:
   After the `---`, the actual blog content begins, written in Markdown. For example:
   - Headers like `#` or `##`.
   - Lists using `-` or `1.`.
   - Code blocks enclosed with triple backticks (` ``` `).
   - Links in `[text](URL)` format.

3. **Ending**:
   After the Markdown content, you simply save the file. There is no additional syntax or ending keyword needed.

### **What to Do**
- Create a directory `public/content/` in your project if it doesn't already exist.
- Add the `post1.md` file (and any other `.md` files for additional posts) to this directory.

Would you like more example `.md` files to test the Markdown rendering further?
